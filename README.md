# Spring 2023 ECE 461 Project Part 1
## CLI for Trustworthy Modules
This project aims to use REST and GraphQL APIs to get metrics (bus factor; correctness; ramp up; responsive maintainer) of how trustworthy different packages and repositories are, and to rate these packages and repositories based off a "net score" using the metrics measured.
